# Easy Tex
Easy tex is a solution to correct the (seemingly?) erroneous mirrored texturing on some of the models in Derail Valley. It is designed to allow people to create liveries that have text properly mirrored and readable on each side.
## Installation
- **Unity Mod Manager** - Drag and Drop the .zip file into UMM to install it
- **Manually** - Drag and Drop the contents of the zip file into the Mods folder in your installation directory
## Information For Texture Artists
**Tanker** - Currently the very top of the tank can appear distorted because the area underneath the pressure relief valve is mirrored into an open area. The easiest fix is to copy the CarTanker_X_01n and CarTank_Paint_01s files (renaming the normal map by changing X to the color of the tank you're texturing, I.E. "CarTank_Blue_01n") into the folder for your skin.
